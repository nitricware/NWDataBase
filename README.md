# NWDataBase
## Introduction
NWDataBase is an XML-based database system for small databases. It provides a lightweight database solution for webspaces where no SQLite is available. The system provides simple functions, including a search function.

## License
The NWDataBase system is distributed under the **MIT License** which allows you to use it privately and commercially, to distribute, modify and sublicense it. You may not hold me liable and must include my name in the credits of your work.

NWDataBase was created by **Kurt HÃ¶blinger** aka **NitricWare**.

## Dependencies
Unlike version 1.x, NWDatabase 2.x and 3.x does not require any additional packages. PHP Extension ```ext-dom``` must be installed, however.

## Usage
Use *Composer* to install NWDataBase to your project via the ```composer require nitricware/nwdatabase``` command or your ```composer.json```.

Alternatively you can also just include all the files from the `src/` directory.

```php
require("NWDatabase.php");
require("NWDBRecord.php");

use NitricWare\NWDatabase;
use NitricWare\NWDBRecord;
```

## Functions
For information about the functions of the class, please check the documentation inside the .php-file!

### With NWDataBase you can:
* Create a database
* Create columns
* Insert records
